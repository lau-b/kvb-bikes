# KVB Bikes Cologne Scraper

This is a simple script that calls the [Nextbike API](http://api.nextbike.net/maps/nextbike-live.xml?city=14) with the Cologne city code and stores the response in a database.

There are als two queries to split the import data into bikes that are kept in a KVB station, and those which just stand around in the streets.
